# Streaming with Suspense

- Streaming allows you to progressively render and send units of the UI
  from the server to the client.
- This allows the user to see and interact with the most essential parts
  of the page while the rest of the content loads - instead of waiting
  for the whole page to load before they can interact with anything.
